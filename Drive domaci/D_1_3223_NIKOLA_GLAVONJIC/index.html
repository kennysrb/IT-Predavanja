          Family has always been the most important thing in my life. I have 1
          younger brother and 1 older sister. My brother's name is Ivan and my
          sister's name is Sandra. She is married and has a child named Andrej.
          Bellow you can see the photo of my family taken during my sisters'
          wedding in 2018. Unfortunately my family lives all around the World,
          and I can say that is some kind of our style of living. I was born in
          Italy, grew up in Serbia, lived and studied in Finland, later moved to
          Hungary then Austria, Switzerland and then to Canada. My brother who
          is also playing hockey lived in Latvia, Denmark and now he is living
          in Slovenia where he is playing hockey nad finishing his masters
          degree in economy. My father recently moved to Miami and hopefully I
          will have time soon to go visit him.Only my sister and my mom live in
          the same city in Belgrade.

          I started playing ice hockey when I was 4 and half years old. Ever
          since then, I loved that game and all other sports in general. I was
          never good at football, but the sports that I was very good were quite
          often linked to adrenaline. I loved snowboarding, wakeboarding,
          surfing and driving all kind of vehicles - jet ski, quads, ski-doo
          etc.
